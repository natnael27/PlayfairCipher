# PLAYFAIR CIPHER
The Playfair cipher is a cryptographic technique that uses a polygraphic substitution method to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext. 
It was invented by Sir Charles Wheatstone but popularized by Lord Lyon Playfair, a Scottish scientist and politician. The Playfair cipher operates on pairs of 
letters, rather than single letters, and uses a 5x5 grid of letters to perform the encryption.
